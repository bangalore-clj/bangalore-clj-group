### Reducing Accretion In Monoliths With Stream Processing
3:00 - 4:00 pm

by [Sourabh Ghorpade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourabh-ghorpade-493a9455/), Product Engineer, Go-Jek


>In this talk, we’ll look at how we migrated critical payment flows out of a monolithic order management system (OMS) to a framework in Clojure that composes event streaming, reliable task scheduling and configuration management in a harmonious way. These actors, in this Actor framework, are capable of processing over 100 million bookings per month. We will walk through why this framework is valuable in handling varied asynchronous flows and how it helps keep the OMS simple by exposing well-defined contracts over Kafka. We will also talk about our journey in making the decision to write this framework and our ongoing effort to move large parts of Go-Jek’s Ride Hailing OMS into these smaller actors.


### Break
