# About

The Bangalore [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) Group hosts one of the most active (since 2010) Clojure meetups in India. All of our meetups are conducted at different locations with different set of speakers every month. Our meetups are scheduled conveniently on every first Saturday of the month.

Our meetups usually have talks by Clojurists, but we organise hackathons on regular basis as well. We are an open community. We encourage and welcome all Clojurists and functional-programming enthusiasts to join us.

Please reach out to us if you have any thoughts on what we can do together or how we can help one another.
